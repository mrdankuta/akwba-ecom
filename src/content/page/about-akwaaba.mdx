## Company History

Akwaaba Foods was established in 2020 out of a passion for sharing delicious Ghanaian flavors with our community. Our founder Vinolia has been refining her recipes and making her signature Shito sauces for years. Now we handcraft all our products in Saskatchewan while staying true to Ghanaian cuisine and culture.

## What "Akwaaba" Means 

Akwaaba means "welcome" in the Akan language spoken widely across Ghana. It represents the spirit of hospitality, community, and warmth that we strive to embody. Just as Ghanaians say "Akwaaba" to visitors as an expression of acceptance, we welcome you to explore new flavors with open arms through our Shito sauces, catering, and experiences.

## Our Founder: [Vinolia Apakoh](/founder-story)

Akwaaba Foods is led by founder and self-taught home cook Vinolia Apakoh. After years of sharing Ghanaian dishes with loved ones, her signature Shito sauces became so popular that she turned her passion into a business. But for Vinolia, Akwaaba is about more than food - it's about cultural connection and community impact.  

## Quality Ingredients & Production

We make our sauces in small batches at a commercial kitchen in Saskatchewan. We source high-quality herbs, spices, seafood and produce - including key ingredients imported right from Ghana! We cook our Shito sauces using time-honored methods to maximize fresh flavors without preservatives or artificial additives.  

## Our Famous Shito Sauces

Our versatile Shito sauces can liven up veggies, proteins, soups, sandwiches - you name it! With savory, smoky flavors and aromatic heat, they make it easy to infuse that authentic African zing into everyday dishes. We offer original recipes packed with herbs and smoked fish, as well as vegan and extra spicy versions.
