For every Shito purchased, we are able to give back to the community!Â Akwaaba Foods provides free hot meals for CityKidz Saturday programs.

**Regina CityKidz** is a nonprofit organization that believes every child matters and every child counts.

Founded on a big dream to see a future free of child poverty, a future where all children have equal opportunity to thrive and achieve their full potential.

## Akwaaba Partnerships!

We are a business that takes pride in working and partnering with the community and believes food creates community!

It is a powerful thing to bring positive change to the community in which we operate and do business, and because of that, Akwaaba has partnered with the **Regina Food Bank** to bring diversity in serving the community.
