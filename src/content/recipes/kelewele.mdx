features:
  - name: Step 1
    value: Wash the plantain and cut them into chunky cubes and set aside.
  - name: Step 2
    value: Prepare the Kelewele mix by roughly blending all the ingredients together
      without the salt.
  - name: Step 3
    value: Add the mix and some salt to the cut plantain and set aside to marinade
      for about 10-15min. This helps it to absorb all the flavours.
  - name: Step 4
    value: Reheat your oil, add the marinaded plantain and cook until it is golden
      brown. Don’t overload the plantain in the oil when frying so they don’t
      soak up.
  - name: Step 5
    value: Once golden-brown scoop out the plantain into a colander to drain out
      excess oil.
  - name: Step 6
    value: Kelewele is now ready to be served with your delicious Akwaaba Spice
      Vegan Shito Sauce.
